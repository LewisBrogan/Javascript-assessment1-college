Assessment task 1: Implement and test code 
Assessment task 2: Prepare technical documentation in line with good practice.

Evidence Requirements: Task 1

•	Use functions and parameter passing
•	Test the code using a recognised test strategy and given test cases
•	Document the results of testing

Evidence Requirements: Task 2

•	Apply meaningful names to variables and functions
•	Ensure that code is well laid out to aid maintainability
•	Internally document the code by adding comments
•	Produce technical guide
